Build Instructions
------------------

1. Make sure GSL is loaded by running: module load gsl
2. Go to the src/ directory and run make
3. Run: cp triaxutd.mod triaxUTD.a <path to CosmoMC directory>/source
   This copies the triaxUTD build and Fortran module file to CosmoMC's source directory.
4. Copy everything in the cosmomc/ directory here to CosmoMC's main directory.
   This will copy the modified Makefile and driver.f90 and calclike.f90 files.
5. Change directory to CosmoMC's main directory and run make.

Re-building Instrunctions
-------------------------

1. After changes to triaxUTD, follow steps 1-3 as above.
2. Change directory to CosmoMC's main directory.
3. Do: rm cosmomc
   This removes the cosmomc build product and lets make re-link with the updated triaxUTD files.
4. Run make.
